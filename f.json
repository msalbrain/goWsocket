It works well, but I can’t stand the scent, therefore I will be returning.. Makes your skin so soft. Even when I get acrylic nails taken off this stuff brings my damaged nails back to life. I wasn’t able to use this more than once—the smell was soawful and lingered—even after I washed my hands. The huge difference with this one is it makes my nails grow so strong and healthy. Great smell and it works super well. I would love it if it came unscented. I've been using this for more than a year now and I'm on my 4th bottle; I can't live without it anymore. I find the smell quite light and fresh and it nourishes without burning my dry cracked skin in the winter months.. My hands don’t really feel that moisturized long term and my nails are definitely not any stronger. Honestly, I was super hyped about this because o love their sunscreen and and wanted to try something else. I purchased this hand cream based on the fact that it had great/positive reviews. It almost cuts my breathing with how strong it’s scent is and it’s not a pleasant scent either. I love Clarins products and this one doesn't disappoint.. I absolutely hate the way this cream smells!
